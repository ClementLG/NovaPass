## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ClementLG/NovaPass.git

    ```

2.  **Create the dictionaries folder**
    At the root of the project, create a folder named `dictionaries`. Place your wordlist files inside this folder (e.g., `english_ef.txt`, `french_diceware.txt`. Already included for quick start). The files must be plain text with **one word per line**.

3.  **Build and run with docker compose**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

4.  **Access the application**
    Once the container is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:5000
    ```

### Recompiling CSS (optional)

This project includes a pre-compiled `output.css` file. If you want to make changes to the styles or HTML classes, you will need to recompile it.

1.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the build command:**
    ```bash
    npm run build:css
